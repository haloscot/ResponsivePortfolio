# ResponsivePortfolio

This is the second assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we were required to revise the portfolio we created in the first homework assignment using a Bootstrap framework. This has been a challenge! I definitely feel like I am learning quite a bit on Bootstrap functionality and linking it with custom CSS styles.
